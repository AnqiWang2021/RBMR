# RBMRï¼šA Two-Sample Robust Bayesian Mendelian Randomization Method Accounting for Linkage Disequilibrium and Idiosyncratic Pleiotropy
**RBMR** is a Mendelian randomization (MR) method to estimate the causal effect by accounting for the LD structure. systematic pleiotropy and idiosyncratic pleiotropy simultaneously in a unified framework. 
## Installation
To install the development version of **RBMR**, it's easiest to use the 'devtools' package.

Use the following command in R to install the package:
```
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("AnqiWang2021/RBMR/RBMR")
```
## Usage
The ['RBMR' Example](https://github.com/AnqiWang2021/MR.LDP/blob/master/vignettes/MRLDP.pdf) will provide a good start point for two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using **RBMR** package.
